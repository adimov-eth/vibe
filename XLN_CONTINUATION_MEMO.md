# XLN Project Continuation Memo

**For: Next Claude Code Instance**  
**From: Architecture Analysis of Complete Development Archive**  
**Date: July 26, 2025**  
**Subject: XLN Extended Lightning Network - Project Context & Technical Handover**

---

## Executive Summary

You are about to work on XLN (Extended Lightning Network), a revolutionary payment channel system that solves Lightning Network's fundamental inbound liquidity problem. This memo provides complete context for a month-long intensive development effort (June 8 - July 8, 2025) between adimov and Egor Homakov that produced a working Byzantine Fault Tolerant consensus system.

**Key Achievement**: A pure functional distributed consensus system implementing Egor's innovative credit-line payment channels with fractional reserve hubs.

**Current Status**: You'll be working with three critical artifacts:

1. **adimov's latest version** - sophisticated BFT consensus with hierarchical state machines
2. **Egor's evolved version** - built on top of adimov's work with his refinements
3. **server.ts MVP** - Egor's 2-day distillation of the entire system into a single file

---

## Project Context & History

### The Problem XLN Solves

Lightning Network has a fatal flaw: to receive $1000, someone must lock $1000 in advance for you. This creates an impossible bootstrap problem. Egor's innovation:

- **Credit-line channels**: Receivers can accept payments immediately without pre-funding
- **Fractional-reserve hubs**: Only custody 20% of balances (vs 100% in traditional channels)
- **Result**: Instant payments that actually work for normal users

This isn't incremental improvement - it's a fundamental rethink of payment channel architecture.

### Development History

**Timeline**: June 8 - July 8, 2025 (31 days intensive work)

- **115-125 total work hours**
- **216 git commits across 11+ versions**
- **131 Claude AI conversations (999 messages)**
- **Marathon coding sessions**: Including 23.5 hours on July 2nd

**Evolution Path**:

- Started: Simple payment channels
- Evolved: Hierarchical state machines with BFT consensus
- Final: Production-grade distributed system with cryptographic proofs

### The Collaboration Dynamic

**adimov's Approach**: Built a sophisticated distributed system with proper abstractions, comprehensive testing, and production features. Focused on architectural elegance and formal correctness.

**Egor's Vision**: Wanted minimal, hand-written code that directly expressed his payment channel concepts. Values simplicity and directness over abstraction.

**The Disconnect**: adimov was building enterprise-grade distributed systems. Egor wanted proof-of-concept demonstrations. Both approaches have merit for different purposes.

**Critical Insight**: After adimov submitted his work, Egor built a complete MVP in 2 days (server.ts) that distills the entire system. Study this file carefully - it represents Egor's mental model made concrete.

## Technical Architecture Overview

### Core Innovation: Hierarchical State Machines

```
Server (Pure Router)
  └── Entity (Business Logic + BFT Consensus)
      └── Channel (Bilateral Payment State)
          └── Account (Individual Balances)
```

### Key Design Principles

1. **Pure Functional Core**: Every layer follows `(prevState, input) → {nextState, outputs}`
2. **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: n ≥ 3f + 1 with weighted voting
3. **Deterministic Execution**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
4. **Local-First Consensus**: No global blockchain bottleneck
5. **Cryptographic Proofs**: BLS aggregate signatures for efficiency

### Consensus Flow (4-Tick Choreography)

1. **ADD_TX**: Transaction enters mempool with signature validation
2. **PROPOSE**: Proposer creates frame from pending transactions
3. **SIGN**: Quorum members sign frame hash
4. **COMMIT**: Aggregate signature (Hanko) finalizes block

### Production Features Achieved

- **10,000+ TPS** with sub-second finality
- **BLS12-381 aggregate signatures** for cryptographic proofs
- **RLP encoding** for deterministic serialization
- **Write-ahead logging** for crash recovery
- **Leader rotation** with timeout handling
- **Comprehensive testing** with property-based verification

## Technical Deep Dive

### State Machine Architecture

The system uses fractal state machines where each layer has the same interface:

```typescript
type Reducer<State, Input> = (
  prevState: State,
  input: Input
) => {
  nextState: State;
  outbox: Message[];
};
```

**Server Layer**: Routes inputs every 100ms tick, maintains global Merkle root
**Entity Layer**: BFT consensus with proposer/validator roles  
**Channel Layer**: Bilateral payment state (future)

### Cryptographic Design

- **Signatures**: BLS12-381 for aggregation capability
- **Hashing**: Keccak-256 (Ethereum compatible)
- **Encoding**: RLP for canonical serialization
- **Addresses**: Last 20 bytes of keccak(pubkey)

### Consensus Mechanism

**Byzantine Fault Tolerance**:

- Tolerates up to f Byzantine nodes where n ≥ 3f + 1
- Default: 5 nodes tolerating 1 Byzantine (3 of 5 threshold)
- Uses weighted voting based on shares, not just signature count

**Leader Rotation**:

- Round-robin proposer selection: `height % members.length`
- Exponential backoff timeouts (5s base, 1.5x multiplier, 60s max)
- Deterministic re-proposal on timeout

### Determinism Requirements

1. **Transaction Ordering**: nonce → from → kind → insertion order
2. **Canonical Serialization**: RFC 8785-style JSON + RLP encoding
3. **State Computation**: Pure functions, no randomness
4. **Timestamp Handling**: BigInt unix-ms throughout
