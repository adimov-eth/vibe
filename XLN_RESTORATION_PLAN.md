# XLN Project Restoration Plan
## Complete Step-by-Step Implementation Guide

### Project Context
XLN implements Egor Homakov's revolutionary credit-line payment channels that solve Lightning Network's fundamental inbound liquidity problem. Current state: working BFT consensus infrastructure, missing actual payment channel implementation.

**Key Innovation**: Credit-line channels enable instant payments without pre-funding, achieving 99.9% success vs Lightning's 70%.

---

## Phase 1: Foundation Synthesis (Weeks 1-2)

### Step 1.1: Architecture Decision
**Goal**: Combine Egor's clarity with adimov's production quality

**Actions**:
1. Start with Egor's MVP (`mvp/server.ts`) as reference implementation
2. Extract core consensus logic into modular components:
   ```
   src/
   ├── consensus/     # BFT consensus (from adimov's entity.ts)
   ├── channels/      # Payment channel layer (NEW - core innovation)
   ├── crypto/        # Real signatures (from adimov's crypto/)
   ├── network/       # P2P transport (NEW)
   └── demo/          # Clear demos (from Egor's approach)
   ```
3. Keep Egor's environment-based architecture but add proper typing
4. Replace mock signatures with real BLS12-381 from adimov's version

### Step 1.2: Consensus Layer Migration
**Goal**: Extract working consensus from both versions

**Actions**:
1. Take `processEntityInput()` logic from mvp/server.ts
2. Add adimov's cryptographic validation from entity.ts
3. Implement hybrid approach:
   ```typescript
   // Keep Egor's direct style but add adimov's safety
   interface ConsensusEngine {
     processInput(env: Env, input: EntityInput): EntityInput[]
     validateFrame(frame: ProposedFrame): boolean
     applyCommit(replica: EntityReplica, frame: Frame): void
   }
   ```
4. Maintain deterministic replay capability
5. Keep comprehensive corner case testing

### Step 1.3: Cryptographic Security
**Goal**: Replace mock signatures with production crypto

**Actions**:
1. Port BLS signature system from `xln01/src/crypto/bls.ts`
2. Implement real signature generation/verification:
   ```typescript
   const frameSignature = await signFrame(privateKey, frameHash)
   const isValid = await verifyAggregate(hanko, frameHash, publicKeys)
   ```
3. Add proper key management for demo/test scenarios
4. Maintain browser compatibility with WebAssembly BLS

## Phase 2: Payment Channel Implementation (Weeks 3-6)

### Step 2.1: Channel Data Structures
**Goal**: Implement Egor's credit-line channel concepts

**Actions**:
1. Define channel state structure:
   ```typescript
   interface CreditLineChannel {
     id: string
     participants: [Address, Address]
     balances: { [addr: Address]: bigint }
     creditLimits: { [addr: Address]: bigint }  // Key innovation
     reserved: { [addr: Address]: bigint }
     nonce: bigint
     disputed: boolean
   }
   ```
2. Implement fractional reserve mechanics
3. Add HTLC support for atomic swaps
4. Design dispute resolution protocol

### Step 2.2: Channel Operations
**Goal**: Core payment channel functionality

**Actions**:
1. Implement channel opening:
   ```typescript
   openChannel(counterparty: Address, creditLimit: bigint): Channel
   ```
2. Implement credit-line payments:
   ```typescript
   // Receiver can accept without pre-funding!
   sendPayment(channel: Channel, amount: bigint, recipient: Address): Payment
   ```
3. Add payment routing through hubs
4. Implement settlement and closing logic
5. Add cross-chain atomic swap support

### Step 2.3: Hub Implementation
**Goal**: Fractional-reserve payment hubs

**Actions**:
1. Implement hub entity that manages multiple channels
2. Add liquidity management (20% reserve requirement)
3. Implement payment routing algorithms
4. Add hub discovery and reputation systems
5. Design hub-to-hub settlement protocols

## Phase 3: Network Layer (Weeks 7-8)

### Step 3.1: P2P Transport
**Goal**: Real network communication between nodes

**Actions**:
1. Implement WebSocket-based transport for demos
2. Add libp2p integration for production
3. Design gossip protocol for consensus messages
4. Add NAT traversal for real-world usage
5. Implement connection pooling and retry logic

### Step 3.2: Message Protocol
**Goal**: Standardized communication protocol

**Actions**:
1. Define wire protocol for all message types
2. Implement RLP encoding for efficiency (from adimov's codec)
3. Add message versioning and compatibility
4. Design authentication and encryption
5. Add message deduplication and ordering

## Phase 4: On-Chain Integration (Weeks 9-10)

### Step 4.1: Smart Contract Integration
**Goal**: Connect to existing Ethereum contracts

**Actions**:
1. Use existing contracts from `xln/contracts/`
2. Implement deposit/withdrawal flows
3. Add dispute resolution mechanisms
4. Connect to EntityProvider for numbered entities
5. Add governance token integration
