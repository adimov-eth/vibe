# SHIP IT - The Real XLN

## The Innovation (One Sentence)

**Let people receive money they don't have yet.**

## The Problem

Lightning Network: You need $1000 locked to receive $1000.  
Western Union: 8% fees, 3 days, and your grandmother needs an ID.  
2 billion unbanked: Can't receive digital payments at all.

## The Solution

```typescript
interface CreditChannel {
  merchant: Address
  hub: Address  
  merchantCredit: bigint  // Hub trusts merchant for this much
  merchantBalance: bigint // What merchant has received so far
}
```

That's it. That's XLN.

## What We're Building (Week 1)

### The Taco Truck MVP

1. **One hub** - PostgreSQL + Express. Runs on Railway for $5/month.
2. **One merchant app** - Single HTML file. QR code + balance display.
3. **One payment flow** - Customer scans → Hub routes → Merchant receives.

NO:
- Byzantine consensus
- Multi-chain support  
- Perfect architecture
- 15 demos
- Abstract entity layers

YES:
- Maria's taco truck accepting payments with $0 lockup
- 2 second payment confirmation
- Real merchant feedback

## The Metrics That Matter

- Merchant onboarding time: <3 minutes
- Payment confirmation time: <2 seconds  
- Weekly volume: $10k
- Merchant quote: "This is better than Square"

NOT:
- Consensus latency
- Byzantine fault scenarios
- Lines of code
- Test coverage

## The Code That Ships

```typescript
// The entire payment flow
app.post('/pay', async (req, res) => {
  const { from, to, amount } = req.body
  
  // Customer → Hub
  await db.debit(from, amount)
  
  // Hub → Merchant (ZERO BALANCE REQUIRED!)
  const channel = await db.getChannel(to)
  if (channel.merchantBalance + amount <= channel.merchantCredit) {
    channel.merchantBalance += amount
    await db.updateChannel(channel)
    ws.send(to, { paid: amount })
    res.json({ success: true })
  }
})
```

## The 4-Week Plan

**Week 1**: Build MVP. Deploy. Test with 1 merchant.  
**Week 2**: Find 10 taco trucks. Onboard them.  
**Week 3**: Add real signatures, USD display, basic fraud limits.  
**Week 4**: Hit $10k volume. Get testimonials.

## What Success Looks Like

- 10 merchants using it daily
- $10k weekly volume
- <1% fees on remittances
- Western Union starts sweating

## The Endgame

Once we prove taco trucks work:
- Open source everything
- Let 1000 hubs bloom
- Build the trust network
- Eat Western Union's lunch

But NOT BEFORE product-market fit.

## The Philosophy

Stop solving Byzantine Generals when Maria just wants to sell tacos.

The innovation is asymmetric credit. Everything else is noise.

Ship the fucking taco truck.
