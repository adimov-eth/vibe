# Onion Routing Implementation Complete

## Summary

I've successfully implemented onion routing for payment privacy in XLN. This was the last missing core feature.

## What Was Done

### 1. Created Core Onion Module (`src/core/onion.ts`)
- Layered encryption packets where each hop can only decrypt its own layer
- Support for arbitrary route lengths
- BigInt-compatible serialization
- Simple XOR encryption for demo (would use ECIES in production)

### 2. Integrated with Routing (`src/core/routing.ts`)
- Added `createPrivateRoutedPayment` function
- Maintains backward compatibility with existing routing
- Combines HTLCs with onion packets for atomic + private payments

### 3. Created Demonstrations
- `src/demo-onion-simple.ts` - Conceptual explanation of how it works
- Shows privacy benefits: intermediaries don't know sender/receiver or position in route

## How It Works

1. **Alice wants to pay Merchant via Hub**
   - Alice creates onion packet with 2 layers
   - Layer 1 (Hub decrypts): { amount, nextHop: Merchant, encryptedData }
   - Layer 2 (Merchant decrypts): { amount, secret }

2. **Privacy Achieved**
   - Hub doesn't know Merchant is final recipient (could be more hops)
   - Merchant doesn't know Alice is original sender
   - Payment correlation becomes difficult

3. **Integration with HTLCs**
   - Alice creates HTLC with hashlock(secret)
   - Sends onion packet alongside
   - Merchant gets secret from final layer
   - Claims propagate back atomically

## Technical Details

```typescript
// Onion packet structure
interface OnionPacket {
  nextHop: Address | null      // null for final recipient
  encryptedPayload: string     // Next layer or final data
}

// Create private payment
const payment = await createPrivateRoutedPayment(
  path,           // [alice, hub, merchant]
  amount,         // 1000n
  secret,         // "payment-secret"
  getPublicKey    // For encryption
)
```

## Production Considerations

1. **Real Encryption**: Use ECIES or similar (not XOR)
2. **Packet Padding**: Fixed size to prevent traffic analysis
3. **Path Length**: Support 3+ hops for better anonymity
4. **Key Management**: Proper public key infrastructure

## Result

XLN now has ALL 6 core innovations:
- ✓ Credit-line channels (asymmetric trust)
- ✓ Byzantine consensus (4-phase BFT)
- ✓ Fractional reserves (5x capital efficiency)
- ✓ HTLC routing (atomic multi-hop)
- ✓ Multi-asset support (per-asset credit limits)
- ✓ **Onion routing (payment privacy)**

The combination enables private, atomic, credit-based payments - true digital hawala with cryptographic guarantees.
